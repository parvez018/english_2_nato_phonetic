# English to NATO phonetic alphabet
For the first few times I talked with an English native speaker over phone, I found it quite challenging sometimes to spell out crucial info, as in name, address ("Is it b, or p?", "g or z?"). One of my friends who is an amateur radio enthusiast, recently told me about this NATO phonetic alphabet that radio operators use, to communicate over noisy channels. I thought to myself this might come in handy for some of us. For those of you who don't want to memorize the NATO phonetic alphabet, this extension is just a simple way to turn any word into a series of NATO phonetic alphabet.
